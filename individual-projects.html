  <p class="intro">The Oneplus is a unique mobile device manufactured in China.It uses both the operating systems Android and Oxygen. Both these OS's combined result in an extremely strong device</p>
  <p>Oneplus&#174 is by far more efficient and user-friendly than iPhone. It enables customers to be able to do business on the go without the use of a laptop.</p>
  <p> All Oneplus&#174 devices come with office apps such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Docs</li>
    <li>Google sheets-Equivalent of Microsoft Excel</li>
    <li>Google Slides-Equivalent of Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
    <li>Google Drive</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Oneplus&#174 has some parameters that one would not expect to run on a phone straight from the factory. </p>
